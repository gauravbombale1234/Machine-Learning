# Data Science & Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Data Science & Machine Learning** repository! This repository provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, techniques, and algorithms used in Data Science and Machine Learning. It covers both foundational topics and advanced methods to equip you with the tools and knowledge for solving real-world data problems.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

### 1. **Mathematics for Data Science**
   - Essential mathematical concepts underpinning data science, including statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus.

### 2. **CRISP-ML(Q) (Cross Industry Standard Process for Machine Learning with Quality Assurance)**
   - A process model that integrates machine learning with a focus on quality assurance at every phase of the project. It includes six phases: Business and Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment, and Monitoring & Maintenance.

### 3. **Clustering**
   - Techniques for grouping a set of objects into clusters such that objects within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.

### 4. **Association Rules**
   - Discovering interesting relationships (rules) between variables in large datasets.
   - Apriori, Eclat, and FP-Growth algorithms.

### 5. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Techniques for suggesting products, services, or information to users based on their preferences and behavior.
   - Collaborative filtering, Content-based filtering, and Hybrid systems.

### 6. **Text Mining**
   - Methods for extracting valuable insights from text data, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

### 7. **Naive Bayes**
   - A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between predictors.

### 8. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.

### 9. **Decision Tree & Random Forest**
   - Decision Trees: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
   - Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them for better accuracy and robustness.

### 10. **Ensemble Learning**
   - Combining multiple machine learning models to improve performance.
   - Techniques include Bagging, Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), and Stacking.

### 11. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Statistical methods used to test assumptions (hypotheses) about population parameters based on sample data.

### 12. **Correlation**
   - Understanding the relationship between variables and how they move in relation to each other.

### 13. **Logistic Regression**
   - A statistical model used for binary classification problems, which predicts the probability of an outcome based on one or more predictors.

### 14. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - A powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the dataset.

### 15. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Techniques for analyzing time-ordered data to uncover trends, patterns, and seasonal variations.
   - ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM.

### 16. **Simple Linear Regression**
   - A regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

### 17. **Multilinear Regression**
   - A regression technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
